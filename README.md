# motorcortex-clip-starter

## Purpose
A starter plugin for creating MotorCortex Clips.

## Structure and Contents
It includes:
* a pre-configured webpack for the needs of viewing your Clip
* pre-configured eslint and babel
* a "clip" folder in order for you to use to define your Clip and Incidents. The folder
contains the `clip.js` file which is just a starting point for your Clip.
* a "demo" folder which is there just for the needs of viewing, debugging and demonstrating 
your Clip. The demo page includes a toolset that you can use in order to export your Clip
as an embedable, portable script

## How to use
Once you've created your new Clip you have the ability to export an embedable, portable
script to use directly on any other website you want.

In order to do so you need to login from the demo page.

## Commands
* `npm run build`: builds the demo
* `npm start`: builds and starts the demo
* `npm render`: render the demo to mp4 video see [dclip-video-renderer](https://github.com/kissmybutton/dclip-video-renderer) from more
